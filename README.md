# Flashlight
Flashlight is a remake of a popular tool turned into a widget. It is designed to provide a flashlight that persists in the background of other activities and/or when the phone screen is turned off. This app is targeted to Lollipop and older devices that do not have native flashlight functionality, but will work for newer Android versions as well.

## Featuring
* Easy flashlight on and off access using homescreen widget
* Quick shutoff notification on lockscreen without entering password
* Settings for auto-shutoff timer
* Enable periodic vibrations when flashlight is on
